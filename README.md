# Hi, I am Rehean Thillai! 👋

## About Me 👨🏽‍💻
I'm a third-year software engineering student at McGill University. I love solving problems and figuring out how tech can make life easier for businesses and people. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me geeking out over new tech, exploring new cooking recipes, hitting the gym, traveling, or just hanging out with friends!

I have industry experience from my two full-stack internships at Libro, where I contributed to a SaaS product used by thousands of restaurants around the world. In addition to my internships, I pursue freelance software development, including creating a lead management tool for a team of 26 insurance agents at Industrial Alliance.

Programming languages: Java, Ruby, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, C, OCaml, SQL <br>
Frameworks/Libraries: Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, React, EmberJS, JUnit, JavaFX, VueJs, Gradle, Git/GitHub
